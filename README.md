# basicNodeJSexercise
- Develop a backend app using Node/ExpressJS running on port 8080
- The backend has 2 APIs, returning a blog list and blog details (based on id/slug). The blog posts are hardcoded on the server.
- From the simple blog frontend app, call APIs to get the necessary data instead of hardcode data.
